What is the program's function?

The Suppliers Management System (SM System) is software designed to allow users to purchase products at the best possible price. This program provides the ability to compare prices offered by various suppliers and identifies the most advantageous option.

How was it developed? 

The program was developed using a combination of programming languages, including: 
•	PHP and SQL for managing the database and software connection; 
•	JavaScript to create scripts that enable the automatic selection of the best supplier; 
•	HTML and CSS for designing the user interface.

The application was developed on a local server using Xampp.

Within the files in the archive, you will find the "shop.sql" file containing the table named "products" with a list of products available for purchase. To test the program on other devices, you need to create a new database and import the "shop.sql" file located in the database folder.
